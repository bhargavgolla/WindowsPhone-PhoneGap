# Minesweeper


This is a simple Minesweeper game developed using Phonegap.

I used [jQuery Metro theme](http://sgrebnov.github.com/jqmobile-metro-theme/). The main code for Minesweeper has been used from [this project](http://code.google.com/p/minesweeper-js/).

## MarketPlace Description

Enjoy your childhood puzzle solving game in your Windows Phone UI. A Minesweeper game developed using Phonegap, this has Native features and native UI.

The AppBar lets you do two things:
* Like the app? You can share it with friends over mail (using mail icon) or social share (using social share icon).
* You can rate the app using the rate icon.

Disclaimer: The list of capabilities that are shown aren't entirely used in this app. 
This is because of an issue in Phonegap decribed [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-109). This will be rectified in next update.
