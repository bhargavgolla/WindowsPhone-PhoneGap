================
This project has been discontinued. All further development will happen [here](https://github.com/bhargavgolla/WindowsPhoneApps/tree/master/FlickrOnTiles)
Market Place Description: Hey all Photofreaks, Ever wanted an app to get your Flickr Photostream and also the comments? Here is an answer to your needs. Login with your Flickr credentials and get your photostream. Not just this, witness the comments on your photo get displayed on the back of tile that shows your photo's caption too. In short, you will get your photo, comments and caption all on a tile flipping continuously. Also, the app tile will be updated with the latest of your photos. So why are you waiting? Download it and have fun.

Disclaimer: The list of capabilities that are shown aren't entirely used in this app. This is because of an issue in Phonegap (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-109). This will be rectified in next update. Thanks for your support. As of now only, Networking, Web Browser Component, Live tiles are the only capabilities used in the app.

This app uses Drew Green Well (http://www.drewgreenwell.com/projects/metrojs) work.
It also uses jQuery Metro theme from [http://sgrebnov.github.com/jqmobile-metro-theme/] and the ChildBrowser Plugin from Phonegap-Plugins [https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/WindowsPhone] and a few other jQuery plugins which can be found if you explore the www folder.

Future Work
