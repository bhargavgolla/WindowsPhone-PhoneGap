Picasa-on-Tiles
===============
This project has been discontinued. All further development will happen [here](https://github.com/bhargavgolla/WindowsPhoneApps/tree/master/PicasaOnTiles)
Just like Flickr-On-Tiles, this will stream Picas aphotos on Tiles.

Disclaimer: The list of capabilities that are shown aren't entirely used in this app. This is because of an issue in Phonegap (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-109). This will be rectified in next update. Thanks for your support. As of now only, Networking, Web Browser Component, Live tiles are the only capabilities used in the app.

This app uses Drew Green Well (http://www.drewgreenwell.com/projects/metrojs) work.
It also uses jQuery Metro theme from [http://sgrebnov.github.com/jqmobile-metro-theme/] and the ChildBrowser Plugin from Phonegap-Plugins [https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/WindowsPhone] and a few other jQuery plugins which can be found if you explore the www folder.

Future Work
-----------

Make an app bar that lets people share this app to social networks.
